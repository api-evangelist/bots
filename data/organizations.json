Employees often get bored of long-lasting, boring corporate wellness platforms, so Addo works in campaigns instead. Once the account is created, your team will have a week to prepare for the first campaign which lasts 21 days: long enough to start getting into certain habits, but short enough not to get bored. At the end of a campaign, the entire team can see a colourful report of how they did, with graphs and information on their performance. Reward the winners and congratulate everyone for the effort and start preparing for the next campaign!

It alerts users of malicious URL/files before the user clicks and gets compromised.nnReally another Bot? For what?nSlack is becoming the operating system for businesses. It is not just a collaboration tool. It is becoming a single place where people chat, exchange technical information, collect the tweets, news articles of their interest, automate their processes etc. With this level of content flowing into Slack from users and also automated sources, there is no security on the content today. The content can be malicious and then end up spreading across your organization very quickly.nnTake an example u2013 you have subscribed to feed for competitive white papers with a pattern match which gets delivered into Slack via an email or some other integration. This trigger results in a malicious file getting delivered to your Slack channel or a URL which hosts malware on it. At this time your entire slack can click on it and suddenly everybody in compromised. This is faster than even email spreading the malware.nnEffectively, DBOT provides security for Slack users and also enables security automation for security analysts using Slack.",

Whether youre an agency looking to connect with clients, a core team coordinating with a local team, or just for fun, Smooz is here to help you connect in a more convenient way. Smooz lets you create a dedicated channel between two Slack teams. Its incredibly easy to set up: 1) Click Add to Slack to get your personal link. 2) Share it privately with the team(s) you want to invite, or embed a public button in your web page3) They click on Add to Slack. Thats it! Smooz will create a dedicated channel in each team, in which you can chat with the other team, as well as send files. Both teams can invite as many users as they want in their channel, rename it, or make it private. Forget about - asking your users to join as single-channel users - asking your client to invite you and your team in their Slack- creating a joint Slack just to discuss a project with a partner.  Smooz is the simplest way to connect with clients and partners.",
